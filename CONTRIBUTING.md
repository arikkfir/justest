# Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project
> you agree to abide by its terms.

## Setup

Only `Go` is required. Make sure the version you have installed matches or supports the version listed in the `go.mod` file.

## Testing

Use `go test` to run the tests locally:

```bash
$ go test ./...
```

## Commit messages

While interim commits in non-main branches do not have to conform to anything, before you can merge a PR, you will have to make sure each one of them both:

- Conforms to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard
- Only uses allowed types & scopes as listed below
- Properly documents breaking changes (see below)
- Message body is required (unlike in the conventional commits standard)
- PR reference is required as a footer (see example below)

### Allowed types & scopes

- `build`: for changes to how the project is built (e.g. changes to Go version), with one of the following scopes:
  - `go`
- `ci`: for changes to CI files like GitHub workflows, with one of the following scopes:
  - `github`
- `docs`: for changes to documentation without corresponding functionality changes, scopes can be any subject matter
- `feat`: for new functionality & features, scopes can be any subject matter
- `fix`: for bug fixes, scopes can be any subject matter
- `perf`: for changes that improve performance, scopes can be any subject matter
- `refactor`: for code structure changes without changing functionality, no scope allowed
- `style`: for fixing code formatting or styling, no scope allowed
- `test`: for adding tests, scopes can be any subject matter

### Breaking changes

Commits that introduce breaking changes **must**:

- Use `!` following their type & scope declaration
- Prefix the commit body with the `BREAKING CHANGE: ` prefix

### Examples

Here's a simple example introducing a new feature:

```
feat(matcher:not): add a new matcher called "Not"

This change introduces a new `Matcher` implementation: `Not`

Refs: #187
```

Here's another example that introduces a breaking change:

```
fix(api)!: remove accidentally exposed method

BREAKING CHANGE: this change removes the `DoSomething()` method which was accidentally
added to the public API of this package.

Refs: #43
```

## Issues and PRs

If you have suggestions for how this project could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions. If you have questions, too, we'd love to hear them.

We'd also love PRs. If you're thinking of a large PR, we advise opening up an issue first to talk about it, though! Look at the links below if you're not sure how to open a PR.

### Submitting a pull request

1. Make sure you set up your local development environment as described above.
2. [Fork](https://github.com/arikkfir/justest/fork) and clone the repository.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
4. Make your change and make sure the entire tests suite passes (see above)
5. Push to your fork, and submit a pull request
6. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

> [!TIP]
> To increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted, follow these guidelines:
> - Add/update tests
> - Avoid unrelated changes, stay focused
> - Keep your PR as small as possible, to make reviewing easier and faster

### Merging strategy

Following restrictions apply:

- Linear history is required for the `main` branch
- That means your branch must be up-to-date and rebased on top of the `main` branch before merging
- That might also mean that occasionally re-review might be warranted if `main` has changed after the PR was approved
- The only merging strategy allowed for PRs is "Squash and merge"
